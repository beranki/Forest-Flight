## Game Proposal ##

We want to adapt the smooth movement mechanics of popular platformer Celeste while adding various different obstacles, combat mechanics, and unique visual themes into the gameplay which will make it a refreshing and replayable take on the platformer genre. The game will be level based, so when you walk off the bounds off a level, you're transported to the next level. The beginning levels will be parkour based to give the player a feel for the movement and the end will be a boss that will test what the player learned in the parkour levels.
Game Controls:

+ W A S D for player movement, possibly space for jump
+ Extra keys for further features that are mentioned below

Game Elements (tentative):

+ Forest Themed
+ Hack and Slash Combat (with upgrades)
+ Grappling Hook
+ Portal Gun movement feature

How to Win:

+ Complete all stages, you advance to the next stage upon completion of the previous stage

## Teacher Response ##

5/23
- Please update your README to reflect the most up-to-date information.  For example, I had to smash keys to find out what the jump button is.  You also seem to have fixed the double jump bug?
- Also, finish your README.  It doesn't paint a complete picture of what the game will be.  I can't tell if this is a series of single screens or a scrollable world.
- Pressing the mouse does a stab action... but how would a player use that when they already have both hands on the keyboard?
- Good core game mechanics.  Now make your game.

## Class Design and Brainstorm ##

Initial Brainstorm: 

Questions 
  1. Should we make it level based (similar to Celeste) where your goal is to get to the last level, 
  2. Or make it only one stage and every time you die you get currency you can spend on permanent upgrades (like Dead Cells)? 
  3. Where do we get our sprites, what is our style for the game?
  4. What is the game called?
